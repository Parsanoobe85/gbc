## Week 1 - History 

- Clay tablets & Cuneiform
- Printing terms
- Egyptians have a cool numbering system

## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes 

- 1 Byte consists of 8 bits
- Binary numbers can only be either 1 or 0
- Every digit of a binary number is 1 bit for example 1001 1100 is 8 bits (1 byte)

## Week 3 - Markdown language 

- Every markdown language is a markup language for example HTML, XML, LaTeX
- To display special characters like '*', '#', '_'  we need to use escaping character before them which is \
- For stroing or exchanging data we normally use JSON language
- People used XML a lot back in the early 2000 now JSON has taken over the place

## Week 4 - Text editors and Keyboards 

- A coder has to be accurate and fast at typing therefore every coder needs to practice touch typing
- Text editors like **VScode**, **Vim** and IDEs are crucial tools for writing and manipulating codes
- We can use online testers like [regex101](https://regex101.com/) or even ai tools like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to test or build regex
- You can make your life easier by using keyboard shortcuts instead of the mouse for example use **CTRL + C** to copy and **CTRL + V** to paste or if you wanna undo a recent change just hit **CTRL + Z**

## Week 5 - Command line Interfaces (CLI)

- The best way to talk and give the computer certain orders is done by using commands in the **CMD** or **Terminal**
- A lot of stuff could be done through CLI like ssh which basically means connecting to another server through network
- Here are some commands we used for bandit game : `pwd`(directory location) `ls`(lists files) `cd`(directory change) `cat`/ `less`(displays file content)
- This is an example of how to use `scp` and `ssh` :

  ```
  ssh username@server_ip

  scp local_file username@remote_server:/path/to/destination
  ```
